## Summary: 

The average temperatures in June and December are only 4 degrees different, but the temperatures in December are colder and fluctuate more. Two additional queries that I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December are:

- Identifying and Addressing Outliers
- Identify average temperatures per weather station. I think it will be intersesting to see temperature information from stations closest to the beach where the surf shop would be located as opposed to temperature information from stations at higher elevations.
